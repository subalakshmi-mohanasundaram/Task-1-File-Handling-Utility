## Task Description

This project is developed as part of the CODTECH Internship under the Java Programming domain. The main objective of Task 1 is to understand and implement file handling concepts in Java. File handling is an essential aspect of programming that allows applications to store data permanently, retrieve stored data when required, and update existing data efficiently.

In this task, a Java program named `FileHandlingUtility.java` has been created to demonstrate three important file operations: writing data into a text file, reading data from a text file, and modifying the file by appending additional content. These operations are implemented using standard classes available in the `java.io` package such as FileWriter, FileReader, and BufferedReader.

The write operation creates a text file called `codtech_file.txt` and writes initial information related to the CODTECH Internship and the task title. This step demonstrates how data can be stored into a file using Java. After writing data, the file is properly closed to ensure that all content is saved successfully.

The read operation accesses the same text file and reads its content line by line. BufferedReader is used to improve efficiency while reading the file. The retrieved content is displayed in the console, ensuring that the data written earlier can be read correctly.

The modify operation appends additional text to the existing file without deleting the previous content. This is achieved by opening the file in append mode. This demonstrates how Java supports safe file modification, which is useful in real-world applications such as log file updates and report generation.

Proper exception handling is implemented using try-catch blocks to handle possible input-output errors gracefully. The program also includes clear comments, making it easy to understand for beginners. Visual Studio Code is used as the development environment to write and execute the Java program.

This task helped in gaining practical experience with Java file handling operations and strengthened the understanding of real-world file management concepts. The project follows proper coding standards and GitHub repository structure as instructed by CODTECH.
